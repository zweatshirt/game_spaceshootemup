# Classic arcade style space shooter 

This was fun to make.
My laptop is on the verge of breaking and I don't have money to fix it so I couldn't add as much to this game as the previous ones. 

There are 5 unique enemies.
You can pick up powerups to improve your ship.
This game made me reminisce of Kingdom Hearts space travel missions/sequences a little.


## Unique additions:

- Different enemies have different health values.  
- I found that the faster third (really 4th, but 3rd index) enemy type should have a lower health, since it's the 'scout/thief' of the game - faster enemies usally have less health.
- The 2nd (really third due to index) enemy is a 'tank' so it has higher health.
- Enemy 4 (really 5) has 20 health, which is kind of a nightmare, but I like a challenge!
- The spawn rate of all enemies increases for every ship taken down. This means that the game becomes virtually impossible eventually, but I like this mechanic.


## NOTE: 

I have a bug with the shield where the value never seems to reach 0, yet every time the shield is broken, the game restarts. I have  absolutely 0 idea why. I spent quite a while trying to figure it out. I am hoping you are lenient with this issue since it's not on the grading rubric/criteria. Also, if you know what the issue is I would love to know so I can fix it.
