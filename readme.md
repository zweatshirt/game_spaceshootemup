# Classic arcade style space shooter 
aka a "shootem' up"

This was fun to make.
My laptop is on the verge of breaking and I don't have money to fix it so I couldn't add as much to this game as the previous ones. 

There are 5 unique enemies.
You can pick up powerups to improve your ship.
This game made me reminisce of Kingdom Hearts space travel missions/sequences a little.

## Unique additions:
- Different enemies have different health values.  
-- I found that the faster third enemy type should have a lower health,
-- since it's the 'scout/thief' of the game - faster enemies usally have less health.
-- The 2nd enemy is a 'tank' so it has higher health.
